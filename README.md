# BB84 Quantum Cryptography Protocol
This is a project done for the undergraduate course “Introduction to Quantum Information and Computation for Robotics” at the University of Genova.

## Description
Simulated a scenario in which two robots (Alice and Bob) must exchange information securely in an environment where communication could be intercepted by a third agent (Eve). [Report](https://github.com/NichAttGH/BB84_quantum_cryptography_protocol/blob/main/Report_BB84.pdf) for more details.

## Tools used
- IBM-Qiskit, an open-source software development kit for programming and quantum computing.

## Results
- The effectiveness of the BB84 algorithm in securing communication between Alice and Bob in the absence of Eve was verified.
- It was shown that the presence of Eve can be successfully detected due to the discrepancy in the keys generated by Alice and Bob.
- The probabilistic nature of qubit measurement and its impact on key security was highlighted.
