# BB84 quantum cryptography protocol

## Description
Simulated a scenario in which two robots (Alice and Bob) must exchange information securely in an environment where communication could be intercepted by a third agent (Eve).

## Tools used
- IBM-Qiskit, an open-source software development kit for programming and quantum computing.

## Results
- The effectiveness of the BB84 algorithm in securing communication between Alice and Bob in the absence of Eve was verified.
- It was shown that the presence of Eve can be successfully detected due to the discrepancy in the keys generated by Alice and Bob.
- The probabilistic nature of qubit measurement and its impact on key security was highlighted.

## Conclusions
- The BB84 algorithm provides a robust method for distributing quantum cryptographic keys, enabling Alice and Bob to detect the presence of an eavesdropper.
- Understanding quantum principles, such as probabilistic measurement, is critical to evaluating the security of quantum communication protocols.
- The project demonstrated the practical applicability of quantum information and computation concepts in the field of robotics.
